      time like what’s happening here. I just don’t want to set up a local server (no matter how simple) for such a
      small project. That being said, I’ve added a few comments on each of the files referenced below, containing the
      expected import/export directives (and other smaller changes) if those files were indeed modules. If that was the
      case, I’d also add the type = ‘module’ attribute to the element referencing index.js and change each file
      extension below to .mjs. -->
